# Mastra + CopilotKit runtime family

This file records the currently installed compatibility family. `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are the executable source of truth; update this file only when the pinned family changes.

## Current pins

| Package | Version |
|---|---:|
| `@copilotkit/runtime` | 1.68.1 |
| `@copilotkit/react-core` | 1.68.1 |
| `@copilotkit/channels` | 0.9.0 |
| `@ag-ui/client` | 0.0.58 |
| `@ag-ui/mastra` | 1.1.4 |
| `@mastra/core` | 1.63.2 |
| `@mastra/memory` | 1.28.1 |
| `@mastra/pg` | 1.22.2 |
| `@mastra/client-js` | 1.42.4 |
| `mastra` | 1.27.2 |

## Runtime contract

- Hosted Mastra storage is Postgres-backed through the guarded store in `src/mastra/pg-store.ts`.
- The hosted store uses the private `mastra` schema with `disableInit: true`; repository migrations own schema changes.
- Local development may use the approved local fallback when hosted storage is intentionally absent.
- CopilotKit request identity and Mastra resource scope are derived server-side.
- Runtime packages should be upgraded as a tested compatibility family, not one package at a time without verification.

## Verification order

1. inspect `package.json`, lockfile, and installed types;
2. run targeted runtime/storage tests;
3. run `npm run typecheck`;
4. run `npm test`;
5. run `npm run build` when the change affects the deployed runtime.

Historical pin decisions and migration plans are preserved under [`../archive/mastra/`](../archive/mastra/).
