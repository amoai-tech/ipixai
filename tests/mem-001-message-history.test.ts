/**
 * IPI-1050 · MEM-001 — prior *normal message history* reaches the next
 * same-thread Planner model call, and a different thread does not inherit it.
 *
 * This file proves the deterministic half of MEM-001: the exact prompt the
 * Planner hands to its language model. It deliberately does NOT claim restart
 * durability — it runs against whatever store the process has, and the store is
 * forced to Mastra's in-memory store below so a developer running this file can
 * never write Planner rows into a real `MASTRA_DATABASE_URL`. The real
 * process-A → process-B restart proof lives in
 * `scripts/mem-001-restart-proof.mjs`.
 *
 * Why the model prompt and not the database: a persisted row (or Working
 * Memory remembering a fact) would be a false green. MEM-001's claim is that the
 * prior turn is *supplied to the model*, so the assertion reads
 * `model.doStreamCalls[n].prompt` — the actual `LanguageModelV2CallOptions` the
 * Planner produced.
 *
 * Two confounds this file rules out on purpose:
 *
 * 1. Working Memory. The Planner configures resource-scoped Working Memory, so
 *    a fact written there would be visible on *every* thread of the resource and
 *    would make the "new thread must not inherit it" assertion impossible to
 *    satisfy honestly. The test therefore never lets the model write Working
 *    Memory, and asserts the fact appears only as a `user` message — never in a
 *    `system` message, which is where Working Memory is injected.
 * 2. Semantic recall. `@mastra/core`'s `memoryDefaultOptions` sets
 *    `semanticRecall: false`, and the Planner passes no embedder/vector, so
 *    recall cannot supply the fact.
 *
 * History window: the Planner does not set `lastMessages`, so Mastra's default
 * applies (`memoryDefaultOptions.lastMessages = 10` at `@mastra/core@1.82.0`).
 * MEM-001 promises bounded recent history, not unbounded context, so every
 * assertion below stays inside that window on purpose.
