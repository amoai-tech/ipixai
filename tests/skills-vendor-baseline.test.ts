/**
 * SKILLS-001 · IPI-1371 — vendored skill content must not drift silently.
 *
 * `skills-lock.json` records 18 vendored skills with a `computedHash`, but that
 * hash is produced by the external vendoring tool and cannot be recomputed here
 * (verified: it is not `sha256` of `SKILL.md`, nor of the skill tree under any
 * obvious normalisation). This test supplies the guard the repository can
 * actually enforce.
 *
 * Why it matters: an edit to vendored content is lost on the next upstream sync,
 * and nothing notices in the meantime. That nearly shipped — a table-of-contents
 * pass briefly covered `cloudinary/references/official/` and the
 * `nextjs-developer` pack before being reverted.
 *
 * When this fails, do not edit the baseline to make it pass. Vendored content
 * changes by re-vendoring from upstream; then regenerate with:
 *
 *   node scripts/skills-vendor-baseline.mjs --write
