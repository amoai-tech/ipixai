/**
 * SKILLS-001 · IPI-1371 — every same-file anchor in an iPix-maintained skill
 * markdown file must resolve.
 *
 * This exists because the first version of this PR's table-of-contents work
 * shipped 11 files whose anchors pointed at nothing. The generator and the
 * verifier shared one slug function, so the check agreed with itself instead of
 * with GitHub. Scanning for the same failure mode afterwards found 22 more
 * hand-written anchors already broken — the oldest long predating this work.
 *
 * The conformance vector below is the real defence. Its expected values were
 * produced by `github-slugger`, the implementation GitHub itself uses, so they
 * are an independent source of truth rather than a restatement of `githubSlug`.
 * The implementation was additionally compared against that package across
 * 16,046 headings in this repository with zero mismatches.
