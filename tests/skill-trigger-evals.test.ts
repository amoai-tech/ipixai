/**
 * Skill trigger evals must be real, not decorative.
 *
 * The `description` field is the primary mechanism deciding whether a skill is
 * consulted at all, so the skill-creator workflow evaluates it with realistic
 * should-trigger and should-not-trigger queries. This repository has carried
 * such a file for `copilotkit` while nothing read it and no skill pointed at it —
 * an eval nothing runs is documentation, not verification.
 *
 * These assertions keep the files honest and are deliberately shallow: they
 * check that an eval set could actually discriminate, not that its cases are
 * well chosen. Judging case quality needs the human review loop.
 *
 * Minimums follow the guidance's "keep it small: 8–12 cases per skill":
 *   - at least 8 cases, so a single case cannot stand in for a suite;
 *   - at least 3 of each direction, so an all-positive or all-negative set fails;
 *   - negative cases must not all be trivially unrelated — enforced by requiring
 *     at least one negative to share vocabulary with the skill's own domain,
 *     which is what makes near-misses worth testing;
 *   - queries must be substantive, because one-line requests like "format this
 *     data" do not trigger skills regardless of description quality.
