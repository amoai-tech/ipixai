/**
 * SKILLS-001 · IPI-1371 — same-file anchor guard for skill markdown.
 *
 * Why this exists: this PR shipped 11 reference files whose generated table of
 * contents pointed at anchors that do not exist, because the generator and the
 * verifier shared one slug function and agreed with each other rather than with
 * GitHub. Review caught it. Scanning for the failure mode afterwards found 22
 * more hand-written anchors already broken, the oldest predating this work.
 *
 * The slug rule below is GitHub's, implemented here rather than pulled in as a
 * dependency. It is validated two ways: by the conformance vector in
 * `tests/skills-reference-anchors.test.ts` (expected values taken from
 * `github-slugger`, the implementation GitHub uses), and at authoring time by
 * comparing this function against that package across every heading in the
 * repository — see the PR evidence. Expected values therefore come from an
 * independent source of truth, not from this implementation.
 *
 * Scope rules — a file is skipped when it is vendored (see
 * `skills-vendor-baseline.mjs`) or when its frontmatter declares an external
 * `source:`, which marks a documentation snapshot whose internal links follow
 * the source renderer's conventions (Mintlify `\[#anchor]`, for example) rather
 * than GitHub's.

/**
 * GitHub's heading slug: lowercase, strip punctuation (keep the literal space,
 * `-` and `_`), then spaces to `-`.
 *
 * Two details are deliberate, and both were wrong before:
 *
 *  - The character class lists a **literal space** rather than `\s`.
 *    `github-slugger` *removes* every other whitespace character — a tab, a
 *    newline, a non-breaking space — and only ever turns a literal space into
 *    `-`. A `\s` class preserved them, producing `a\tb` where GitHub produces
 *    `ab`.
 *  - There is **no `trim()`**. `github-slugger` does not trim, so `" a"` becomes
 *    `"-a"`. Trimming looked harmless because `markdownHeadings` already strips
 *    surrounding whitespace, which is exactly why the original 16,046-heading
 *    comparison reported zero mismatches while both defects were present: no real
 *    heading exercises either path. Synthetic vectors are the only thing that
 *    catches them, which is why the conformance vectors below include whitespace.

/**
 * Slugs for a heading list, in document order, with GitHub's dedupe.
 *
 * GitHub's rule (the one `github-slugger` implements) is a `while` loop, not a
 * one-shot suffix: it keeps bumping the counter until it lands on a slug that is
 * still free. Getting this wrong is subtle and was a real defect here — for
 * headings `Foo`, `Foo`, `Foo-1` a one-shot counter yields `foo`, `foo-1` and
 * then reuses `foo-1`, while GitHub yields `foo`, `foo-1`, `foo-1-1`. The reuse
 * makes this guard accept a link to an id no heading owns, and reject a link to
 * the id GitHub does create.

 * contain a three-backtick line. A naive toggle invents headings and links out of
