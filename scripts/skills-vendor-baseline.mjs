/**
 * SKILLS-001 · IPI-1371 — vendored-content drift guard.
 *
 * `skills-lock.json` records 18 skills vendored from upstream with a
 * `computedHash`, but nothing recomputes it: that hash is produced by the
 * external tool that performs the vendoring, and its algorithm is not in this
 * repository (verified — it is not `sha256` of `SKILL.md`, nor of the skill tree
 * under any obvious normalisation, so a test cannot reproduce it).
 *
 * The gap that leaves is real: an in-place edit to vendored content is silently
 * lost on the next sync, and nothing notices. That nearly happened — a
 * table-of-contents pass over 73 reference files briefly included
 * `cloudinary/references/official/` and the `nextjs-developer` pack.
 *
 * So this module owns a baseline the repository *can* verify: a deterministic
 * tree hash per vendored subtree, using an algorithm defined here.
 *
 * Discovery rule — a skill subtree is vendored when ANY of:
 *   1. its name appears in `skills-lock.json`; or
 *   2. its `SKILL.md` frontmatter declares an upstream author and no `-ipix`
 *      version suffix (a pure vendor snapshot rather than an iPix overlay).
 *
 * A `references/**` subtree inside an otherwise iPix-owned skill is vendored
 * when it carries an `UPSTREAM.md`, or when its markdown frontmatter declares an
 * upstream `author`/`hub` with no `-ipix` version.
 *
 * The `-ipix.N` suffix is the discriminator between "upstream snapshot we must
 * not edit" and "iPix overlay we own".
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/skills-vendor-baseline.mjs [--write]
