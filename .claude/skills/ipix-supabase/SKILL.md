# ipix-supabase — Supabase hub

Single entry point for Supabase work on **iPixai** (same live project as Lumina: `nvdlhrodvevgwdsneplk`). Combines topic files + [`references/project-rules/`](references/project-rules/).

**Hard gates:** normal Supabase work is migration-file-first and verified locally. Do not mutate production manually; reviewed merge/deploy/recovery workflows own production writes. Mastra-specific persistence changes still require their own preview/golden-test gates. This repo now contains `supabase/`; the old `/home/sk/ipix` repo is read-only reference only.

**Load child `SKILL.md` on demand** — do not paste their bodies here.

## Folded topics (load on demand from `references/`)

> **Consolidation note:** the former standalone skills `edge-functions`, `supabase`,
> `supabase-cli`, and `supabase-postgres-best-practices` are now `references/` inside this hub.
> Behavior preserved; only the packaging changed.

| User intent | Reference |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Start here** — iPix project, PLT tables, local fresh-replay, verify-rls | *(this hub)* `SKILL.md` + topic files (`postgres.md`, `realtime.md`, `storage.md`, …) |
| Deno edge functions, JWT, Gemini in functions | [`references/edge-functions/edge-functions.md`](references/edge-functions/edge-functions.md) + [`edge-functions.md`](edge-functions.md) + [`references/edge-functions/edge-functions-inventory.md`](references/edge-functions/edge-functions-inventory.md) — see **Edge Functions reference index** below |

## When NOT to use

- **Mercur catalog** (products, orders, sellers) — lives on Mercur Postgres, not Supabase
- **Auth0 / Clerk / Firebase** as primary auth — iPix uses Supabase Auth (PLT-002)
- **Raw Postgres** without Supabase client, RLS, or Edge Functions in scope

## Triggers

supabase, RLS, auth.uid, edge function, Deno.serve, verify_jwt, storage bucket, signed URL, migration, supabase-js, service role, publishable key, brands, brand_scores, ai_agent_logs, verify-rls, fresh-replay, local Docker.

---

## Project identity

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **Project ref** | `nvdlhrodvevgwdsneplk` |
| **Dashboard** | https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nvdlhrodvevgwdsneplk |
| **Policy** | Local fresh-replay (`supabase start` / `db reset --local`) is the proven verification method — CI-enforced via the `supabase-fresh-replay` job on every PR (see IPI-1162). In the normal workflow, do **not** manually run `supabase db push --linked`, `supabase migration repair`, or `supabase db reset --linked` against production; production migration application is owned by the reviewed merge/deploy path. |
| **Commerce** | **Mercur** — never duplicate product/order tables in Supabase |

Mastra schema notes: [`docs/mastra/supabase-mastra.md`](../../../docs/mastra/supabase-mastra.md)  
Old operator repo (read-only reference): `/home/sk/ipix/supabase/`

### MCP / CLI trust

1. Prefer the **Supabase plugin/MCP for read-only live inspection** when it is confirmed on `nvdlhrodvevgwdsneplk`; record the project ref in evidence.
2. Use **local CLI + Docker** for migration replay and destructive testing. Use `--linked` only for explicit read-only state checks such as migration listing/lint/dry-run.
3. **`npm run supabase:verify-rls`** after every RLS change when the script exists; also run the affected targeted SQL tests. Do not hard-code a check count because the suite evolves.
4. Cursor **`user-supabase` MCP** may show legacy Medellín/FashionOS objects — **ignore** unless MCP is confirmed on `nvdlhrodvevgwdsneplk`.
5. Never treat plugin/CLI permission errors as permission to change production manually; change verification method or escalate.

---

## iPix MVP tables (PLT-001)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `brands` | Operator brand profiles (`user_id`, `ai_profile` jsonb) |
| `brand_scores` | DNA scores (`score_type`, `score`, `details`) |
| `commerce_product_links` | Supabase ↔ Mercur `medusa_product_id` |
| `ai_agent_logs` | Agent runs (`duration_ms`, tokens, model) |
| `assets` | + `brand_id`, `dna_score`, `dna_status`, `dna_pillars` |
| `profiles` | PLT-002 sync with `auth.users` |
| `shoots` | Shoot metadata (legacy, still used) |

Legacy FashionOS tables coexist on the shared project — do not extend them for iPix MVP without audit ([SEC-001 / IPI-52](https://linear.app/amo100/issue/IPI-52)).

## Repo coordinates (iPixai)

Wire clients under `src/` when they exist. Until then, treat the table below as **target layout**, not proof the files are already here.

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Supabase client | `app/src/lib/supabase/` for the operator app; verify exact current path before editing |
| Mastra storage | PostgresStore → `mastra` schema — preview first |
| Types | Do **not** regenerate via MCP `generate_typescript_types` blindly — it can emit `public` only and drop other schemas. Prefer CLI `--linked` + `git diff --stat` |
| Edge functions / migrations | `supabase/` in this repository; old `/home/sk/ipix/supabase/` is read-only historical reference |
| Client env | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` |
| Server secrets | never `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for service role |

## Daily verification path

Do **not** `cd /home/sk/ipix` from this repo. This repository now owns `supabase/` and the fresh-replay CI path.

1. Inspect current repo migrations/schema first.
2. For an existing live DB object being changed, retrieve its authoritative installed definition before editing — never reconstruct functions, triggers, policies, views, or privileged RPCs from memory, issue prose, or reviewer comments.
3. Prove migrations locally with `supabase start` + `supabase db reset --local` (or the exact CI equivalent).
4. Use the plugin/linked project only for read-only comparison, Advisors, and post-deploy verification unless an explicitly approved migration/recovery workflow owns the write.
5. Never use Dashboard SQL editor, manual `db push --linked`, `migration repair`, or `db reset --linked` as the normal development path.

### New migrations

When this repo has `supabase/migrations/`:

```bash
supabase migration new <name>
# edit supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>.sql
```

Do not `supabase db push` to production as a normal development step. Historical IPI-126 / PLT-era remote-apply notes are no longer workflow authority; current migration ownership is defined by the reviewed merge/deploy path and the project rules below.

Do **not** rewrite applied remote history. Local Docker/fresh replay is now an active required verification path; historical notes that call it deferred are stale.

## Core principles

1. **Database is source of truth.** RLS enforces this — not frontend state.
2. **Verify, don't assume.** Run advisors + `verify-rls` before declaring done.
3. **Service-role key never reaches the browser.** Edge functions / CLI only. No `VITE_*`.
4. **Every new iPix table has RLS.** No exceptions in `public`.
5. **Use `(select auth.uid())` / `(select auth.jwt())` when row-independent** so Postgres can initPlan/cache them per statement; do not wrap row-dependent functions blindly.
6. **Grants + RLS are separate gates.** A correct policy cannot compensate for an unintended table/function grant, and a missing grant is not an RLS denial.
7. **UPDATE ownership must protect both old and new rows.** Review `USING` and `WITH CHECK`, and remember UPDATE also needs a SELECT policy.
8. **Views are an exposure boundary.** Public/API-facing views should normally use `security_invoker = true` or be kept out of exposed schemas / have access revoked.
9. **SECURITY DEFINER is exceptional.** Default to invoker; if definer is required, set a safe `search_path`, schema-qualify references, classify whether direct RPC execution is intended, and verify ACL + tenant behavior.
10. **Advisor finding ≠ automatic fix.** Classify intent and prove impact before moving extensions, dropping indexes, changing grants, or modifying legacy objects.

## iPix edge functions (as-built — verified live 2026-07-20)

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `health` | Liveness |
| `edge-test` | Authenticated Gemini smoke (replaces legacy `gemini-ping`) |
| `brand-intelligence` | URL → brand profile (Gemini + urlContext + responseSchema) |
| `start-brand-crawl` | Firecrawl v2 crawl job start (IPI-24) |
| `capture-lead` | Public lead capture from the marketing chatbot (WEB-015.2) -- writes `chatbot_conversations`/`chatbot_messages`/`lead_intake_drafts` |
| `firecrawl-webhook` | Firecrawl signed webhook → `brand_crawls` / `brand_crawl_results` |
| `audit-asset-dna` | Image DNA scoring — writes `assets.dna_score`/`dna_status`/`dna_pillars` |

**Do not** copy Medellín/mde edge functions from MCP inventory — different product.

Full per-function detail (verify_jwt, models, secrets): [references/edge-functions/edge-functions-inventory.md](references/edge-functions/edge-functions-inventory.md). After adding functions: also update `supabase/config.toml` → run [scripts/verify-edge-inventory.sh](scripts/verify-edge-inventory.sh).

### Two separate Gemini call paths -- do not conflate them

This repo has **two independent routes to Gemini**, not one:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph nextjs["Next.js operator app"]
        MA["Mastra agents"] -->|AI_GATEWAY_URL| CFW["Cloudflare AI Gateway Worker<br/>services/cloudflare-worker/"]
        CFW --> LLM1["Gemini / Groq"]
    end
    subgraph edge["Supabase edge functions"]
        BI["brand-intelligence /<br/>audit-asset-dna"] -->|"GEMINI_API_KEY, direct SDK call"| LLM2["Gemini"]
    end
```

- **Mastra agents** (the Next.js operator app) call out through the Cloudflare AI Gateway Worker -- see `app/src/lib/ai/provider-adapter.ts` (`AI_GATEWAY_URL`) and CLAUDE.md's Cloudflare section.
- **Supabase edge functions** (`brand-intelligence`, `audit-asset-dna`) call Gemini **directly** via the `GoogleGenAI` SDK + the `GEMINI_API_KEY` secret (`supabase/functions/_shared/gemini.ts`) -- they do **not** go through the Cloudflare Worker at all.

Don't assume Cloudflare AI Gateway guidance applies to edge functions, or that edge-function Gemini calls show up in Cloudflare AI Gateway logs -- they won't.

---

## Storage (PLT-011 — Cloudinary, not Supabase Storage)

**MVP decision:** Cloudinary holds bytes; Supabase holds metadata in `assets` + optional `cloudinary_assets`.

- Folder: `ipix/{user_id}/{brand_id}/{asset_id}`
- Edge: `cloudinary-sign` (signed upload params), `register-asset` (persist row)
- Secrets: `CLOUDINARY_*` edge-only — see `docs/supabase/secrets-inventory.md`
- Spec: `docs/linear/issues/IPI-30-PLT-011.md`
- **Do not** create `ipix-assets` Supabase buckets for MVP unless explicitly re-approved

Legacy FashionOS `storage` buckets and shoot-scoped RLS remain — extend with brand-owner policies via forward migration.

---

## Auth (PLT-002)

- **Operator:** `app/src/app/(operator)/app/*` — session via Supabase SSR (`app/src/lib/supabase/server.ts`, `session.ts`)
- **Login:** `app/src/app/(marketing)/login` · callback `app/src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`
- **Legacy Vite:** `/login` + `ProtectedRoute` in `src/` — retire with [IPI-89](https://linear.app/amo100/issue/IPI-89)
- Google OAuth: `signInWithOAuth({ provider: "google" })` with redirect to `/app`
- Prod redirect URLs: [IPI-125](https://linear.app/amo100/issue/IPI-125)

### Auth references — `references/auth/`

| File | When to load |

## Universal security checklist

- **`user_metadata` is user-editable** — never authorize from it
- **UPDATE needs SELECT** RLS policy
- **Storage upsert needs INSERT + SELECT + UPDATE** policies
- **Service role never in `app/` or `src/`**
- Extend `scripts/verify-rls.mjs` when adding tenant-scoped tables
- **`maybeSingle()`/`single()` calls MUST check `error` before checking for a missing row.** `maybeSingle()` returns `{ data: null, error: null }` on a genuine miss but `{ data: null, error: PostgrestError }` on a real DB/RLS/network failure — treating both the same way (`if (!data) notFound()`) silently converts real outages into a misleading 404. Found via 3 independent PR reviewers flagging the exact same line on IPI-536/PR #347. Always: `const { data, error } = await ...; if (error) throw error; if (!data) notFound();` — never skip the error check.
- **A bulk-access RLS policy does not automatically cover "can a user see their own row."** `assignments_select_org` (`supabase/migrations/20260709000000_planner_schema_rls.sql:468-470`) required manager+ to `SELECT` *any* `planner.assignments` row, including the caller's own — so a contributor/viewer checking their own permissions got zero rows and was treated as unassigned (P1 bug, PR #347). Any time you write an RLS policy for "managers/owners can see everyone's records," ask the separate question **"can a user see their own record too?"** at write time — if yes, add a narrow `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC hard-scoped to `auth.uid()` (never a caller-supplied user id) alongside the bulk policy, don't wait for a reviewer to find the gap. See `public.planner_get_my_assignment` (migration `20260712235000`) for the pattern.

## Pre-ship checklist

- [ ] Applicable proof classes from [`references/verification-matrix.md`](references/verification-matrix.md) are identified and satisfied.
- [ ] Migration-bearing change fresh-replays locally from scratch; no synthetic application state was added merely to make history replay.
- [ ] Existing functions/triggers/policies/views changed in this task were compared with their authoritative installed definitions first.
- [ ] RLS/grants changes include allowed + denied role/tenant cases; UPDATE checks old and resulting row where ownership can change.
- [ ] SECURITY DEFINER / public RPC / view exposure is explicitly classified and ACL/search-path/security-invoker state proved where applicable.
- [ ] `npm run supabase:types` if exposed schema changed.
- [ ] `npm run supabase:verify-rls` and affected targeted SQL tests pass when applicable.
- [ ] Fresh replay also passes `supabase/tests/security/catalog-security-regression.sql`; any exception is exact and reviewed, not a weakened global rule.
- [ ] Security + performance Advisors reviewed; findings are triaged, not blindly fixed.
- [ ] No service role or Gemini key in client bundle.
- [ ] Edge function CORS + JWT/custom-auth contract documented and tested.
- [ ] Exact-head CI is green; after deploy, applicable live state is verified read-only.

## Companion skills

- [`tasks`](../tasks/SKILL.md) — canonical Linear task definition/execution standard
- [`task-verifier`](../task-verifier/SKILL.md) — independent evidence gate; use Adversarial for Supabase security/data-integrity work

Legacy `ipix-task-lifecycle` / `pr-workflow` are compatibility-only; do not route new Supabase work through them.

## Source of truth

| Location | Role |
|----------|------|
| `.claude/skills/ipix-supabase/` | The one Supabase skill — hub + iPix topic files + `references/` (incl. folded edge-functions, supabase-core, cli, postgres-best-practices) |

## Exit conditions

- Routed to correct topic file(s)
- iPix project ref respected; verified via local fresh-replay; for any `supabase/migrations/**` change, explicit human approval was obtained *before* merge (merge itself applies to production — IPI-1171) and that approval is recorded; no manual destructive command (`db push --linked`, `migration repair`, `db reset --linked`) run outside that approved path
- RLS verify run after policy changes
- Inventory updated after edge function add/remove
