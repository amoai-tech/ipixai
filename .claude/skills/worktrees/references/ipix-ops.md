# iPix worktree operations — command playbooks

Command recipes for the iPix worktree workflow. The always-on guardrails (merge gate, never-run-blindly, leak guard, nested guard, backup rule) live in [../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) under "iPix safety rails"; this file holds the longer how-to recipes those rules point at.

## Table of contents

- [Forensic audit](#forensic-audit) — what state am I actually in?
- [Documentation preservation gate](#documentation-preservation-gate) — commit or split docs before remove (P0)
- [Production SHA check](#production-sha-check) — does local main match remote/deployed?
- [PR splitting playbook](#pr-splitting-playbook) — keep PRs reviewable
- [Weekly tidy ritual](#weekly-tidy-ritual) — clear stale branches/worktrees

## Forensic audit

Run before any merge, cleanup, or `--force`/`reset` so you can name exactly what exists and what would be lost. Never trust a "looks clean" impression — probe.

```bash
git status --short                          # staged, unstaged, untracked summary
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard    # untracked files (respecting .gitignore)
git ls-files --others | grep -E 'worktrees/|^github/|node_modules/' || echo "no leaks"  # leak check (incl. ignored)
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD         # local commits NOT on remote main
git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD          # diff size (files + lines) vs merge-base
git diff --stat --staged                    # what's staged right now
git stash list                              # stashes you may have forgotten
```

Read the output before acting:
- Untracked files you don't recognize → investigate, don't blanket-clean.
- Local commits ahead of `origin/main` → these are unpushed; removing the worktree with `--force` destroys them.
- Large `diff --stat` → candidate for the [PR splitting playbook](#pr-splitting-playbook).

## Documentation preservation gate

**Run in the worktree you're about to remove** — after merge, abandon, or weekly tidy. Operational detail for [../SKILL.md § documentation preservation gate](../SKILL.md#documentation-preservation-gate-mandatory--p0).

**Mandatory question:** Are there uncommitted or unpushed docs/audits/plans that should become permanent repo knowledge?

### 1. Inventory everything not on the remote

```bash
WT=/path/to/worktree   # e.g. ../wt-ipi-286-route-aware-sections
git -C "$WT" fetch origin
git -C "$WT" status -sb
git -C "$WT" log --oneline origin/$(git -C "$WT" branch --show-current)...HEAD 2>/dev/null || \
  git -C "$WT" log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
git -C "$WT" ls-files --others --exclude-standard
git -C "$WT" diff --stat
git -C "$WT" diff --cached --stat
```

### 2. Flag doc paths (review every line)

```bash
git -C "$WT" ls-files --others --exclude-standard | rg -i \
  '\.(md|mdx|mdc|csv|json|sql)$|^docs/|^tasks/|^linear/|^\.claude/|^\.@worktrees/|Universal-design|README|AGENTS\.md|CLAUDE\.md' || true
```

Also scan **modified** docs not in the merged PR:

```bash
git -C "$WT" diff --name-only HEAD | rg -i '\.(md|mdc)$|^docs/|^tasks/' || true
```

### 3. Triage each flagged file (three outcomes only)

| Outcome | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **1. Commit it** | Useful project knowledge → task PR or split docs-only PR |
| **2. Move to canonical location** | Valuable but wrong path → move under `docs/` or `tasks/`, then commit |
| **3. Delete intentionally** | Junk, duplicate, stale, or unsafe — explicit confirmation only |

If unsure → `ipi/docs-preservation-<slug>` branch/PR before remove.

**Hard rule:** zero untracked doc paths remain before `git worktree remove`, unless the user names specific paths to discard in chat.

### 4. Machine gates (must pass)

```bash
npm run worktree:pre-delete              # from inside $WT
node scripts/worktree-health.mjs --pre-delete
```

### 5. Remove only when clean

```bash
git -C "$WT" status -sb                   # expect clean (or only gitignored build artifacts)
git worktree remove "$WT"
git worktree prune
# after merge confirmed on GitHub:
git branch -d "$(git -C "$WT" branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)"  # if still on that branch, run before remove
```

### 6. Log for the ship report

Paste into PR comment or Linear close-out:

```text
Worktree removed: <path>
Doc preservation: <committed PR # | moved + committed | preservation PR # | none — tree was clean>
pre-delete: green
audit count after: <n> worktrees
```

**Reference:** incident log [`.@worktrees/worktrees.md`](../../../../.@worktrees/worktrees.md) — `tasks/llm/`, `docs/llm/`, design package loss from force remove without salvage.

## Production SHA check

Confirm your local `main` (and your worktree's base) matches the remote/deployed `main` before branching or merging — a stale base produces conflicts and "works on my machine" surprises.

```bash
git fetch origin main
git rev-parse origin/main                   # remote main = what's deployed from lumina-studio
git rev-parse main                          # your local main
git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...main   # "<behind>  <ahead>"
```

- `0  0` → in sync. Safe to branch/merge.
- behind > 0 → fast-forward local main (`git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`) before creating worktrees, so they branch from current code. (iPix worktrees default to `origin/main` via `claude --worktree`, which sidesteps this — but a manually based worktree inherits a stale local main.)
- ahead > 0 → you have unpushed commits on main; that should almost never happen on iPix (work goes on `ipi/*` branches). Investigate.

Cross-check against the deployment platform's reported commit SHA (e.g. the Vercel/host build for `lumina-studio`); `origin/main` should equal the live deployment's SHA.

## PR splitting playbook

Large agent-generated PRs are slow to review and risky to merge. Keep each PR to **one concern**.

**Split when** `git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD` shows roughly >400 changed lines or >15 files, **or** the change spans more than one layer (schema / edge function / frontend).

**How to split — by dependency layer, one worktree per slice:**

1. Schema + RLS migration → `ipi/<id>-schema` → PR #1
2. Edge functions that depend on the schema → `ipi/<id>-edge` → PR #2 (blocked by #1)
3. Frontend that calls the edge functions → `ipi/<id>-ui` → PR #3 (blocked by #2)

```bash
# one worktree per slice so each validates independently
git worktree add ../wt-ipi-117-schema -b ipi/117-schema origin/main
git worktree add ../wt-ipi-116-edge   -b ipi/116-edge   origin/main
```

- **Stack** dependent PRs: branch the later slice off the earlier branch (not `origin/main`) and note "Blocked by #N" in the PR body.
- Each slice runs the full [tasks pre-merge-tests](../../tasks/references/pre-merge-tests.md) matrix in its worktree.
- Prefer several small green PRs over one big PR that mixes concerns.

## Weekly tidy ritual

Run periodically (≈weekly) from the main worktree to keep branches and worktrees from accumulating.

```bash
git worktree list                       # audit what exists
git worktree prune                      # drop metadata for manually-deleted worktrees
git fetch -p                            # prune remote-tracking branches deleted upstream

# delete local branches already merged into origin/main (skips main + current)
git branch --merged origin/main | grep -vE '^\*|(^|\s)main$' | xargs -r git branch -d

# for each merged/abandoned worktree from `git worktree list`:
#   1. Run Documentation preservation gate (above) — commit/split docs first
#   2. npm run worktree:pre-delete inside that worktree
git worktree remove <path>              # add --force only after salvage gate + backup (see SKILL.md)
```

Review the `git worktree list` and `git branch` output by hand before deleting — confirm each branch is truly merged or abandoned, and that no worktree holds uncommitted work (run the [forensic audit](#forensic-audit) on any you're unsure about).
