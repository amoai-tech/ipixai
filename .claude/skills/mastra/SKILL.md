# Mastra Framework Guide

## How to use this skill

Do not read every Mastra reference. Start here, classify the risk, then load the smallest owner set from [`references/README.md`](references/README.md).

```text
What am I changing?
→ implementation owner reference
→ testing-gates.md for required proof
→ user-journeys.md when operator-visible business flow changes
→ task-verifier for independent Done evidence
```

Ownership examples:

```text
tool implementation        → tools.md
workflow/HITL              → workflows.md
memory/persistence         → memory.md
Stop/abort                 → streaming.md
auth/RequestContext        → supabase-auth.md
model evals                → evals-feedback.md
pre/post-merge evidence    → testing-gates.md
end-to-end iPix business flow → user-journeys.md
observed failure diagnosis → common-errors.md
package upgrade            → migration-guide.md
```

One reference should not impersonate another: workflow docs explain HOW; testing gates define WHAT must pass; journey docs prove the operator outcome across systems.

## Core rule — verify exact installed behavior

Mastra evolves rapidly. APIs, constructor signatures, workflow semantics, memory behavior, processor contracts, and package-family compatibility change frequently.

For exact-version implementation questions use:

```text
current iPix code + live task owner
→ installed TypeScript types/source
→ embedded docs when that installed package actually ships them
→ this iPix Mastra skill/index
→ official Mastra MCP / current docs
→ official GitHub source/tag/issues when still ambiguous
```

Do not assume every installed `@mastra/*` package ships embedded docs. Do not let latest web examples override pinned installed APIs.

For dependency changes:

```text
record full installed Mastra/CopilotKit/AG-UI family
→ identify proven incompatibility or required feature
→ inspect migration/release guidance
→ choose one compatible target family
→ upgrade only required packages together
→ targeted type/runtime/memory/workflow/streaming regressions
```

Never use `npm update @mastra/core` or install `latest` as a generic troubleshooting step.

## Current iPixai wiring — as built

**Location:** `src/mastra/` in current iPixai. Old Lumina/iPix `app/src/mastra/` is reference material only.

Current shape must be re-checked on the task SHA:

```text
CopilotKit / AG-UI
→ current Next.js auth/session boundary
→ server-derived org + user identity/resourceId
→ Mastra local agents
→ default registry entry resolves to Production Planner
→ typed compute/read tools
→ Mastra Memory
→ shared PostgresStore
→ Supabase `mastra` schema
```

Rules:

- **Auth:** current product auth is the existing Next.js/CopilotKit server boundary. Do not add a second standalone Mastra auth architecture or browser-owned bearer-token authority without an explicit task.
- **Context:** browser org/brand/shoot/thread/run/page IDs are claims until server verified. `RequestContext` is request-scoped runtime metadata, not authorization.
- **Agent registry:** do not reintroduce weather/demo agents or duplicate aliases without a current caller requirement.
- **Storage:** hosted paths requiring durable Mastra state fail closed when approved Postgres config is unavailable. No silent in-memory/LibSQL durability claims.
- **Postgres:** reuse existing shared/process-scoped store/pool configuration; do not create a new pool/store per request unless a proven installed-runtime constraint requires it.
- **Model/provider:** use current V2 ownership; do not port Lumina Cloudflare `resolveAgentModel` because it existed historically.
- **Tools:** typed input/output schemas; consequential domain writes require server/domain authorization and approval boundaries.
- **Dev:** `npm run dev:agent` (`:4111`) and `npm run dev:ui` (`:3000`) separately — never combined `npm run dev`.
- **MCP:** pass `projectPath` only to tools whose schema requires it and use this repo root. Do not pass it to `mastraDocs`.

`docs/mastra/10-mastra-convert.md` is historical migration research, not current architecture SSOT.

## Lumina → iPix adaptation rule

Lumina is useful for **business invariants, deterministic logic, schemas, fixtures, and failure lessons**. It is not runtime authority.

Never classify an entire mixed Lumina Mastra file as one `PORT`/`DROP` unit. Follow `../tasks/references/migration-lumina.md` and classify each symbol/behavior independently.

Typical decisions:

```text
Planner business sequencing           → EXTRACT + REUSE
least-privilege tool selection         → REIMPLEMENT on current registry
pure compute logic + tests             → PORT / ADAPT after current-data verification
browser page-context trust model       → REIMPLEMENT with current server verification
workflow stage ordering                → REUSE invariant
suspend/resume transport               → REIMPLEMENT on installed current stack
Cloudflare model router                → DROP
DurableAgent/old Worker glue            → DROP unless current reproduced need
JWT/service key in tool/workflow data   → DROP
legacy direct DB write tools            → REIMPLEMENT at current domain/server boundary
```

Known Lumina traps that must become tests:
- `approved: false` must not suspend again as if no decision exists;
- approval binds to exact validated artifact/revision/hash;
- resume cannot silently recompute a materially different proposal;
- browser IDs/context are untrusted until server verified;
- credentials never enter workflow/suspend/memory/trace/model context;
- callback resume validates expected run + external job identity and rejects replay;
- provider failure fails closed and cannot surface stale prior output as fresh success.

## Mastra risk classes

At task start classify applicable concerns:

`agent registry/identity` · `model/provider` · `tool schema` · `tool authority` · `external side effect` · `RequestContext/tenant context` · `memory scope` · `persistent storage` · `streaming/Stop/abort` · `workflow` · `suspend/resume` · `HITL approval` · `MCP` · `observability/evals` · `package-family change`.

Tenant identity, memory ownership, consequential tools, approval/resume, callbacks, persistent storage, cancellation, authenticated MCP, sensitive RequestContext/observability fields, or package-family changes require Adversarial `task-verifier` coverage.

## Independent proof classes

| Proof class | What it proves |
| -- | -- |
| Registry/config | intended agent/model/tool/workflow is actually selected |
| Deterministic primitive | tool/step/schema logic works without model nondeterminism |
| Model behavior | natural language selects the right primitive/arguments |
| Authority/context | caller/org/context is server verified; foreign claims fail |
| Memory | correct thread/resource scope and no tenant bleed |
| Persistence/restart | required state survives a real new process/instance |
| HITL artifact | human approved exact immutable revision/hash |
| Resume/recovery | stale/duplicate/foreign/malformed resume cannot advance/duplicate |
| Streaming/abort | cancellation reaches downstream work, not only visible SSE |
| Side-effect idempotency | retry/double-resume/lost-response creates at most one effect |
| Observability/evals | diagnosable and reproducible without protected-data leakage |
| Exact runtime | exact deployed SHA performs the operator journey |

Invalid substitutions:

```text
tool unit test passes       ≠ model routing proof
model routes correctly      ≠ authorization proof
message persisted           ≠ restart recall proof
approved=true               ≠ exact artifact approval
stream ends                 ≠ downstream abort proof
single write succeeds       ≠ retry safety
trace exists                ≠ privacy-safe business evidence
higher eval score           ≠ comparable regression proof without versioned inputs
```

## Tools

Review material tools across four independent dimensions:

```text
schema correctness
+ business correctness
+ authority/context correctness
+ agent-selection correctness
```

Use current `createTool` source/types. Prefer both input and output schemas where supported. Current Mastra validates declared tool output schemas at runtime, but installed-version proof still wins.

For external/expensive tools, propagate `abortSignal` when the installed integration supports it. A forced `toolChoice` test may supplement deterministic coverage but cannot be the only natural-language routing proof.

## Memory

Keep separate:

```text
message history = conversation turns
working memory  = structured state at configured scope
resource/thread = identity/partition keys
authorization   = server/domain truth, never memory
```

Prove message history restart, working-memory scope, foreign-resource denial, and hosted durable storage independently.

Do not enable semantic recall or Observational Memory merely because upstream supports it; require a dedicated use case with quality, latency/cost, concurrency, restart, privacy and rollback proof.

## Workflows / HITL / snapshot discipline

Default consequential flow:

```text
AI proposal
→ canonical artifact/revision/hash
→ suspend + human review
→ server verifies approver/org/run/step/artifact
→ explicit approve/reject
→ resume exact revision/hash
→ revalidate current domain state
→ idempotent domain commit
→ record result/audit
```

Workflow snapshots are durable execution state, not blob storage. Keep them bounded: stable IDs, hashes, small typed state and minimal resume metadata. Keep raw crawl pages, large model/provider responses, full media payloads and duplicated domain records in their owning durable system and reference them by stable ID.

Large HITL payloads require realistic snapshot/storage/memory proof. Size optimization must never weaken exact-artifact approval provenance.

## Streaming / Stop

Where cancellation is required, prove:

```text
Stop
→ request/runtime AbortSignal
→ agent/workflow
→ tool/provider/MCP/external call where supported
→ no later protected side effect
→ stream closes cleanly
```

Upstream Mastra has fixed several abort-propagation gaps over time; do not assume current-main behavior exists in the pinned installed family.

## RequestContext / privacy

Mastra can propagate RequestContext through agents/tools/workflows and into tracing/datasets depending on configuration. Therefore:

- keep fields minimal and bounded;
- never include JWTs, auth headers, session cookies, service keys, provider secrets or passwords;
- avoid raw customer/brand records or large prompt/media payloads when IDs suffice;
- verify exporter/retention behavior before adding sensitive context;
- keep authorization checks at the server/domain boundary.

See [`references/supabase-auth.md`](references/supabase-auth.md).

## Observability / evals

Use traces/evals to diagnose and improve real business behavior, not to create decorative scores.

For comparative eval evidence record:

```text
exact git SHA
agent/config version
model/provider
Mastra family
dataset ID + version
scorer/rubric version
material runtime flags
```

Prefer deterministic tests for safety/authorization/idempotency. Build datasets from real iPix failure modes and inspect per-case failures/variance before promoting a scorer threshold to a hard CI gate.

## Mastra docs MCP / Studio / CLI

Use installed source/types for exact pinned APIs and official Mastra MCP/docs for current concepts/migrations. An empty embedded-doc search does not prove an API is absent.

Use repository-owned dev commands and local CLI only:

```bash
npm run dev:agent
npm run dev:ui
npx --no-install mastra --version
npx --no-install mastra api --help
```

Never use a bare `npx mastra` that can fetch a newer package unexpectedly, and do not overwrite this iPix overlay with upstream skills wholesale.
