# iPix skills

Canonical reusable/cross-agent skills live in `.agents/skills/`. `.claude/skills/` is the Claude discovery/compatibility layer; `claude_exposed: true` means the Claude entry must be a symlink to the canonical skill.

Source of truth: `.agents/skills/registry.json`.

## Claude-only / iPix-specific discovery skills

These remain real directories under `.claude/skills/` and are outside the canonical `.agents` registry until explicitly migrated.

## Governance

- One real directory per skill.
- Add or remove canonical skills by updating the registry and the filesystem together.
- `npm run skills:registry:check` validates inventory, delegates, aliases, and Claude symlinks.
- `npm run skills:index:check` fails when this generated index is stale.
- `tests/skill-reference-contract.test.ts` validates canonical skill handoffs/reference files and repository skill paths.
